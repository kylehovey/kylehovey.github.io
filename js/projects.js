		description : "This is a WireWorld Cellular Automata simulator written in JavaScript. WireWorld is a CA capable of logic simulation. In fact, it is Turing Complete! This in-browser interpreter allows you to create structures, copy, paste, delete, and pause/play/step simulations.",

		title : "Villein Number Translator (2016)",
		nav : "Villein\nTranslator",
		description : "In Cyan's new game Obduction there is an alien race called the Villeins. Part of the game is figuring out their numbering system, which uses a three-by-three grid on which five \"digits\" can lie. The whole system is base-4, and I had a bunch of fun figuring it out. I wanted to create a translator to quickly verify numbers, so I made one husing the html5 canvas.",

		title : "Euler Golf (2015)",
		nav : "Euler\nGolf",
		description : "When I was attending Cuesta College in San Luis Obispo, I had an idea for a game over the Gaussian Integers (complex numbers of the form a+bi where a and b are both integers). I quickly found that the game was evil in difficulty, and as I shared it with friends I also learned that it was not just me. In light of this newfound challenge, I created an in-browser version as a Hackathon project. More info can be found on the site.",

		title : "Ulam Spinner (2016)",
		nav : "Ulam\nSpinner",
		description : "Some projects start with vague ideas and oversized ambition. Most of the time, those types of ideas crash and burn in a humble fire. Sometimes, though, they can result in something worthwhile. In this case I wanted to somehow use the fact that complex numbers encode modular arithmetic to express primality in a visual way. The Ulam Spiral is a famous mathematical object that writes integers spiraling out from the origin and colors primes differently than non-primes. What you get is countless surprising linear patterns. I wanted to do the same thing, but with \"complex\" spinners that represent spinning complex numbers that would align when the criteria for \"division\" was met. I still think it is possible, but in the mean time I have a configuration that uses colors and spinners in a pattern that is perhaps a bit too colorful.",
