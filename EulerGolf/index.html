	<center><h3>This is a puzzle game that I created when thinking about complex numbers.<br>
		That being said, no knowledge of the workings of complex numbers are needed<br>
		to play or complete the game. Instead, you can think of this game as a sort of<br>
		navigation puzzle in a strange grid where every move depends on your last.<br></h3>
	<h3>The gameboard you play on consists of positions in a two-dimensional grid,<br>
		and the rules of this grid are the following:<br>
	</center>
	&nbsp;
	&nbsp;
	&nbsp;
	&nbsp;
	<div style="width:630px; text-align:left; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;">
	<h3><ol style="display: inline-block">
		<li>You begin at the point one unit right from the center</li>
		<li>Every move consists of a 90 degree rotation around your last position</li>
		<li>The inital point that you rotate around is the origin</li>
		<li>You must navigate to a target point, outlined in red and blue</li>
	</ol></h3>

		Holding the left and right arrow keys, or touching the left-hand or right-hand<br>
		sides of the screen will move your pointer. Hit the <b>U</b> key to undo a move.
