I created an ember class that has an internal fire value and a customized sigmoid curve function that will map the embers' fire values to something between 0 and 1. A stoke method adds a random integer in a specified range, and a diminish method multiplies the fire variable by a predetermined constant (0<k<1). I was so happy with the results that I wanted to create an in-browser version. This time, I used HTML5 and JS to create a grid of embers. I shaped the fire on the page by making the range for the random constant that each ember is stoked with depend on the ember's position on the page.
