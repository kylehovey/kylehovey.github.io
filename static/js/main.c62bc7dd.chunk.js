I wanted to see if I could reproduce the MNIST convnet example using D'ni numbers. To generate training data, I wrote the segments in isolation and created a script to produce combinatorial sets of the individual segments I created.

We had just installed a mod that added basic digital components to the game, and my friend was constructing a processor. I knew nothing about architecture at that point, but I wanted to learn more. I began my journey reading "Digitial Computer Electronics" by Malvino and started constructing the basic modular components of a computer. Eventually I had constructed a processor of my own design. The final product had EM interference which induced signalling issues, but the knowledge I gained benefits me to this day. I made a website and tutorial to aid anyone who wishes to acheive the same goal.

Since I camp a lot, I wanted to simulate fire on it with the hopes of creating a calming lantern for my tent. I decided to go with a slightly neural-network inspired approach. I created an ember class that has an internal fire value and a customized sigmoid curve function that will map the embers' fire values to something between 0 and 1. A stoke method adds a random integer in a specified range, and a diminish method multiplies the fire variable by a predetermined constant (0<k<1). I was so happy with the results that I wanted to create an in-browser version. This time, I used HTML5 and JS to create a grid of embers. I shaped the fire on the page by making the range for the random constant that each ember is stoked with depend on the ember's position on the page. Vertically there is a linear gradient, and horizontally there is a gaussian distribution determined by page width.",link:"FirePlace/index.html"},{title:"Acoustic Forest",icon:h.i,image:j,year:"2016",brief:"2D Procedural landscape that is reactive to sound",description:"A natural continuation of my FirePlace project and an ode to John Muir and the mountains, I created Acoustic Forest: a music visualizer that uses procedurally generated terrain with unique elements augmented by distinct frequency bands in a song. I decided to go with Muse's \"Exogenesis Symphony Part 3\" which I claim absolutely no rights to and will take down at first request of any proprietor's request. I chose the song because it just so happened that Muse's masterful composition consists of a crescendo of increasing layers of elements, then a decrescendo back out. The structure of the song itself is a mountain in shape, which made it perfect to bring in elements slowly, then bring them out in reverse order.
