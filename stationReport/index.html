For analysis purposes we will use every possible combination of station for an excess of 130,000 possible combinations. To narrow things down a bit, each possibility is ranked with respect to prospective cost and additional drives possible as ranked by our corridor driving model.</p><p>A supported trip is defined to be an instance of a trip possible between one location to another. In this way, we are referring to the abstract trip possible on a route and not the trips taken on the routes themselves. Other metrics may be used, but this simple measure allows us some specificity in our choices of buildout while remaining easy to understand and implement.</p></div><div class="col-md-6"><h2><i class="fa fa-chart-bar"></i> Dimensionality Reduction</h2><p>Even though seventeen stations were analyzed for the potential to enable more electric vehicle trips, there were twelve stations that made no contribution to the goal inasmuch as including any combination of them did not make any further trips possible. This left five stations for the final analysis:</p><ul><li>Lunt Park</li><li>Kanarraville</li><li>Perry</li><li>Weber Canyon</li><li>Echo</li></ul></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><h2><i class="fa fa-flask"></i> Results</h2><p>For the simulations, a battery capacity of 25kWh is used, as well as our calibrated model for determining energy consumption based upon elevation change, rolling resistance, distance, and other factors specific to every electric vehicle. This model assumes an "average EV".</p><p>To estimate the cost of building a station, a base cost of $30,000 was assumed. Then, we used the proximity to nearby transformers and their power ratings to estimate the final cost. When a transformer could not be located, a cost of $50,000 was assumed (this is a rough upper-bound).</p><p>Below are the results of simulating drives along the corridors of Utah with different buildouts. Click on any of the points in the scatter plot to see how the given buildout contributes to potential trips between popular destinations. To aid in visibility, the only trips shown in the chord plot are those which are helped by the buildout. Note that, at this time, we are not doing any volume or time-based analysis and are simply looking at the decision problem: is a trip possible, or would an average EV run out of energy?</p></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12"><h4><i class="fa fa-road bullet"></i> Aggregate Daily Traffic Across Corridors Enabled by Buildout: <span class="key-number" id="aggregate"></span></h4><h4><i class="fa fa-dollar-sign bullet nudge"></i> Estimated Cost of Buildout: <span class="key-number" id="cost"></span></h4></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-12" id="stations"></div></div><div class="row"><div class="col-md-6"><div class="chart" id="chart"></div><p class="lead" id="click-tip">Click on points or station names for more info.</p></div><div class="col-md-6"><div class="chart" id="chord"></div><div class="color-key"><dl><dt class="red"><div></div></dt><dd>No Trip Possible</dd><dt class="blue"><div></div></dt><dd>Trip Possible One Way</dd><dt class="green"><div></div></dt><dd>Trip Possible Both Ways</dd></dl></div></div></div></div><div class="overlay fullpage-transparent vertical-center" id="loader"><div class="sk-cube-grid"><div class="sk-cube sk-cube1"></div><div class="sk-cube sk-cube2"></div><div class="sk-cube sk-cube3"></div><div class="sk-cube sk-cube4"></div><div class="sk-cube sk-cube5"></div><div class="sk-cube sk-cube6"></div><div class="sk-cube sk-cube7"></div><div class="sk-cube sk-cube8"></div><div class="sk-cube sk-cube9"></div></div></div><script src="./js/app/report/bundle.js"></script></body></html>
