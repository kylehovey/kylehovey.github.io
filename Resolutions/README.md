# New Years Resolution - JSON Edition

Set some new years resolutions! Just edit the `resolutions.json` file in the root of this repo and the resolutions will update on the next page load. If you wish to edit the look/feel of the list, edit in the `src` directory and re-run `gulp` to compile JS/CSS. Go crush it!
